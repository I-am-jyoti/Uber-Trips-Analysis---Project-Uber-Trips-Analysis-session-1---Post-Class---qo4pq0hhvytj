This data exploration project focuses on analyzing various aspects of Uber pickups in August, including date, time, location (latitude and longitude), and the affiliated TLC base companies. The overarching business problem is to enhance customer satisfaction and improve the availability of cabs, thereby reducing waiting times for customers.

The project aims to gain valuable insights into customer behavior, booking patterns, and geographical distribution to inform strategies for improving service quality. The key objectives include determining the number of unique TLC base companies, identifying the date with the highest pickups, analyzing the busiest time of day, exploring the distribution of pickups over time, visualizing the geographical distribution with a scatter plot, comparing the performance of TLC base companies, and examining the percentage distribution of pickups across different days of the week. These insights will contribute to informed decision-making for optimizing Uber's services and enhancing overall customer experience.
